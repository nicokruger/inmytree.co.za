Like many of you, my morning starts with coffee, catching up on news and then getting into work, catching up on emails, and then starting on work tasks. Except that for the last week, I've been doing the above in a desolate cave, a log cabin overlooking a mountain, a space station orbiting the Earth, and many more exotic locations.

I've been working in Virtual Reality for the last week.

# Working in Virtual Reality

One of the benefits of my job is I have an excuse to try new things. So a week or so ago Digitata bought an Oculus Quest 2 so that I can evaluate the relevance of Virtual Reality for Digitata's remote work future.

The benefits of Virtual Reality for work/productivity applications can be summarised as follows:

  - Isolation.
  - Presence.
  - Collaboration.
  - Virtual Screens.

## How does VR solve these things?

### Virtual Screens
You can have as many screens as you want

### Isolation
You can completely remove yourself from your physical surroundings and focus. The environment 

### Presence
One of the things we all miss from the days of going to office is being present with other people. VR goes some way to alleviate this.


### Collaboration
This is the thing I miss the most. Working together in small groups hunched over a computer solving a problem. Virtual Reality allows us to share screens.
